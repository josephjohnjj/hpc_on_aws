# Ansible Configuration File
# Purpose: Disable SSH host key checking for automated environments
# Author: [Your Name]
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------
# This configuration is useful for dynamic infrastructure setups,
# such as AWS EC2 instances launched with Terraform, where host keys
# are not known in advance and SSH prompts would block automation.

[defaults]
# Disable host key checking in Ansible
# This prevents Ansible from prompting:
# "The authenticity of host can't be established..."
# Useful for CI/CD or ephemeral instances where manual confirmation
# is not possible or desirable.
